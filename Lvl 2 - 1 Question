1. How does parallel programming/computing works? What do you think
will be the advantage of utilizing parallel approach?

Advantages of parallel processing. The benefits of parallel computing include quicker "big data" processing and more effective code execution,
which can save time and money. More resources can be used in parallel programming to address more difficult tasks.
In order for many processors connected by shared memory to run smaller, independent, frequently comparable sections of bigger problems concurrently,
this technique is known as parallel computing. The completed results are then integrated as part of a larger algorithm.
